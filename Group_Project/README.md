## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth
This project has been a profound journey of intellectual and professional development. Through exploring complex datasets and designing intuitive visualizations, we gained insights into the intersection of data science and political analysis. We refined our technical skills in Python, enhanced our understanding of demographic influences on elections, and fostered collaboration within an interdisciplinary team.  

By applying advanced visualization techniques like Sankey diagrams and interactive choropleth maps, we bridged the gap between abstract data and meaningful insights. This experience has not only enriched our academic knowledge but also equipped us with the professional tools to tackle real-world data challenges.

## Research Question
How do demographic factors—such as age, gender, race, education, income, and occupation—impact U.S. election outcomes in North Carolina?

## Methodology
We utilized Python libraries and open-source geospatial tools to integrate and analyze voting and demographic data. Our visualizations were designed to highlight trends in voter behavior, geographic clustering, and demographic impacts.

### Data Sources
1. **North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE)**: County-level voting results.  
2. **NC OneMap Geospatial Data**: Geographic shapefiles of county boundaries.  


## Visualizations
Key visualizations include:  
1. **Choropleth Maps**: Geographic distribution of voting trends.  
2. **Sankey Diagrams**: Proportional relationships between demographic categories and party affiliations.  
3. **Density Plots**: Voter age distribution by party.
